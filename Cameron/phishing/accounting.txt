Hello Joe Dirt,

This invoice needs to be approved ASAP!

We need to collect payment from this customer so we can meet our quarterly numbers, and more importantly GET THE BIG BONUS CHECK this week! 
Today is the final day to qualify for this bonus so make sure to open the invoice attached and approve it ASAP! 
Please follow the following instructions so we can pass this to the customer TODAY and you’ll see the bonus in THIS WEEKS CHECK and I heard it’s a BIG ONE!

•	Open the attached xls invoice
•	Click "Enable Editing" if prompted 
•	If prompted that “Macros have been disabled” click “Enable Content” THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT as it automatically sends the invoice to the customer


<insert picture of macros enabled here if possible>

•	Collect the BIG BONUS and HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!

Thanks for your help on this Joe we’re all really counting on you to get us over the finish line!

Ricky Bobby,
